Since I have tomcat running on linux, it's practical to use this to deploy, say a .war file, since I'm frequently working on java web projects on my Mac. Simply use the scp command, specify the file for transfer, your username and hostname followed by the absolute path to where the file needs to go. It prompted me for a password, and moved the file without any trouble. Wonderful.</p>",
